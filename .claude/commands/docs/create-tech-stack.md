# Generate Tech Stack Documentation

**User Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Context

- Project root: !`pwd`
- Package.json: @package.json
- Node version: !`node --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Node.js not found"`
- TypeScript config: @tsconfig.json
- Database schema: !`ls -la prisma/schema.prisma 2>/dev/null || echo "No Prisma schema found"`
- Existing docs: !`ls -la .taskmaster/docs/*.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No docs yet"`

## Goal

Create comprehensive Tech Stack Documentation based on deep codebase analysis. Document all technologies, frameworks, libraries, development tools, deployment strategies, and implementation patterns with specific versions and configurations.

## Process

### 1. Automated Technical Discovery

- Parse package.json for all dependencies
- Analyze configuration files (tsconfig, vite.config, next.config, etc.)
- Detect database setup (Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, etc.)
- Identify testing frameworks and tools
- Scan for CI/CD configurations
- Check deployment configurations

### 2. Deep Code Analysis

Examine codebase for:

- **Architecture Patterns:** Monorepo structure, module organization
- **Framework Usage:** Next.js app router vs pages, API routes
- **State Management:** Zustand, Redux, Context API patterns
- **Styling Approach:** Tailwind, CSS modules, styled-components
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript strictness, validation libraries
- **API Design:** REST, GraphQL, tRPC implementation
- **Authentication:** Auth libraries and session management
- **Testing Strategy:** Unit, integration, E2E test patterns

### 3. Interactive Technical Q&A

Ask 4-6 deployment and infrastructure questions:

- Use numbered/lettered options
- Focus on non-discoverable information
- Gather hosting, monitoring, and workflow details

### 4. Generate Comprehensive Documentation

Create detailed tech stack document with:

- Specific version numbers
- Configuration examples
- Command references
- Architecture diagrams (when applicable)

### 5. Save and Organize

- Create `.taskmaster/docs/` if needed
- Save as `tech-stack.md`
- Update CLAUDE.md commands section

### üë• Development Workflow

**4. What's your Git workflow?**

a) **Feature branches** with PR reviews  
 b) **Trunk-based** development  
 c) **GitFlow** with release branches  
 d) **Direct to main** (solo project)

**5. How do you manage environments?**

a) **Multiple deployments** (dev, staging, prod)  
 b) **Preview deployments** for PRs

### üîê Additional Services

**6. Which external services do you integrate with?**

- [ ] Payment processing (Stripe, PayPal)
- [ ] Email service (SendGrid, Resend, AWS SES)
- [ ] File storage (S3, Cloudinary, UploadThing)
- [ ] Authentication (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth)
- [ ] Search (Algolia, Elasticsearch)
- [ ] Other APIs (please specify)

## Document Structure

The generated document must follow this technical structure:

### **Overview**

- Brief description of the application's technical nature
- Technology stack summary
- Architecture approach (monolith, microservices, etc.)

### **Programming Language & Runtime**

- Primary programming language and version
- Runtime environment and version
- Type system and language features used

### **Frontend**

- UI Framework/Library and version
- Styling approach and frameworks
- Component libraries and design systems
- State management solutions
- Build tools and bundlers
- Browser support and compatibility

### **Backend**

- Backend framework and architecture
- API design (REST, GraphQL, tRPC, etc.)
- Authentication and authorization
- Middleware and security
- File handling and uploads

### **Database & Storage**

- Database type and version
- ORM/Query builder
- Schema management and migrations
- Caching solutions
- File storage solutions
- Data backup and recovery

### **Development Tools & Workflow**

- Package manager
- Code formatting and linting
- Type checking and compilation
- Testing frameworks and strategies
- Development server and hot reload
- Version control workflow

### **Deployment & Infrastructure**

- Hosting platform and services
- Build and deployment pipeline
- Environment configuration
- Domain and DNS management
- SSL/TLS and security

## Target Audience

The document should serve:

- **Developers** joining the project who need technical onboarding
- **DevOps engineers** setting up infrastructure and deployment
- **Technical architects** evaluating or improving the tech stack
- **Security teams** understanding the technical landscape
- **Future maintainers** who need to understand technical decisions

The language should be technical, precise, and include specific version numbers and configuration details.

## Documentation Principles

### DO Include:

- **Exact Versions:** Lock file versions, not just ranges
- **Configuration Examples:** Actual config snippets from the project
- **Command Reference:** All npm scripts and their purposes
- **Setup Instructions:** Step-by-step for new developers
- **Architecture Decisions:** Why specific technologies were chosen
- **Integration Details:** How services connect and communicate

### DON'T Include:

- **Generic Descriptions:** Avoid Wikipedia-style explanations
- **Outdated Information:** Only document what's actually used
- **Wishful Thinking:** Document current state, not future plans
- **Sensitive Data:** No API keys, secrets, or credentials
- **Redundant Info:** Link to official docs instead of copying

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `.taskmaster/docs/`
- **Filename:** `tech-stack.md`

## Execution Steps

### 1. Automated Analysis Phase

```bash
# Extract key technical information
- Read package.json and lock files
- Scan for configuration files
- Detect framework patterns
- Identify database setup
- Find test configurations
```

### 2. Manual Discovery Phase

- Read key source files to understand architecture
- Check for API route patterns
- Analyze authentication implementation
- Review deployment configurations

### 3. Interactive Q&A

- Present deployment and infrastructure questions
- Use checkboxes for multi-select options
- Wait for user responses

### 4. Document Generation

- Start with discovered information
- Incorporate user responses
- Add specific configuration examples
- Include all npm scripts with descriptions

### 5. Save and Update

```bash
# Create directory and save
mkdir -p .taskmaster/docs
# Save to .taskmaster/docs/tech-stack.md
```

### 6. Update CLAUDE.md

Add discovered commands to the Commands section:

```markdown
### Development

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

# ... other discovered commands
```

### 7. Next Steps

- Suggest: "Would you like me to update CLAUDE.md with the discovered commands?"
- Recommend: "Should I create an app design document to complement this technical documentation?"
