# Research for Tasks

- **User Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Goal

Research current best practices, or solutions to help with task implementation.

## What You Can Say

```
"Research MSAL security best practices for task 5"
"How to use MSAL to acquire security tokens (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens) using various authentication flows?"
"Research Flask vs FastAPI"
"Find the latest Microsoft Graph REST APIs and SDKs documentation 2025"
```

## How It Works

I'll research what you asked about (User Request) and:

1. **Get current information** beyond my knowledge cutoff
2. **Include relevant context** from your project if needed
3. **Show you the findings**
4. **Update tasks** if you mentioned specific ones

Just tell me what you need to know and optionally which task it's for.
