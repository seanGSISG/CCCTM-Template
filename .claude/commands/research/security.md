**User Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Goal

Research security best practices, vulnerabilities, and compliance requirements.

## What You Can Say

```
"Latest OWASP top 10 for web apps"

```

## How It Works

I'll research security topics and:

1. **Find current vulnerabilities** and mitigations
2. **Get compliance requirements** if applicable
3. **Provide secure implementation** patterns
4. **Update relevant tasks** with security considerations

Critical for security-sensitive features.
