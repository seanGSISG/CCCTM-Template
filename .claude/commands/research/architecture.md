# Research Architecture

**User Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Goal

Research current architectural patterns, system design best practices, and scaling strategies.

## What You Can Say

```
"Research microservices vs modular monolith for SaaS"
"Best practices for event-driven architecture 2024"
"How to scale WebSocket connections to 100k users"
"Database sharding strategies for multi-tenant apps"
"Research CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns"
```

## How It Works

I'll research architectural topics and:

1. **Get latest patterns** and industry best practices
2. **Include project context** if relevant
3. **Provide actionable recommendations**
4. **Save findings** if requested

Great for making informed architectural decisions before implementation.
