# Research for Tasks

- **User Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Goal

Research current best practices, or solutions to help with task implementation.

## What You Can Say

```
"Research JWT security best practices for task 5"
"What's the best way to handle file uploads in Next.js?"
"Research MongoDB vs PostgreSQL for our use case"
"Find React Query v5 migration guide"
```

## How It Works

I'll research what you asked about (User Request) and:

1. **Get current information** beyond my knowledge cutoff
2. **Include relevant context** from your project if needed
3. **Show you the findings**
4. **Update tasks** if you mentioned specific ones

Just tell me what you need to know and optionally which task it's for.
